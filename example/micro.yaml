# Conversions allow you to convert files to other formats on upload.
# This is intended for converting inefficient formats like gif to webm (40mb>4mb in testing).
# The original copy will be discarded.

# Video conversions rely on ffmpeg which is a slow and flakey process. If possible,
# it's recommended to disable conversions and just don't upload gifs.

# The recommended options are below, on low power devices like a raspberry pi you should disable conversions entirely.
# This is currently not retroactive, but in the future old files may also be converted.
conversions:
  # You cannot convert video/* to image/* and vice versa. How would that even work?
  # image/gif to video/webm is an exception.
