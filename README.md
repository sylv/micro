## installation

> [!NOTE]
> If you need help, join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/VDMX6VQRZm). This guide assumes you are on linux with a basic understanding of linux and docker.

> [!TIP]
> If you are already familiar with docker, you can look at the [compose file](./example/compose.yml) and [config file](./example/.microrc.yaml) to get setup quickly. The below is a more detailed guide for inexperienced users.

1. Install `git` and `docker`
2. Download the files in this repository, `git clone https://github.com/sylv/micro.git`
3. Copy the example configs to the current directory, `cp ./micro/example/* ./`
4. Fill out `.microrc.yaml`, `Caddyfile` and `docker compose.yml`. **It is extremely important you read through each of the 3 files and make sure you understand what they do.** Specifically, `.microrc.yaml` contains a secret that handles authentication, if it is not a secure random string everyone can sign in as anyone they want without a password.
5. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the database and micro.
6. Get the startup invite by doing `docker compose logs micro` and copying the invite URL that should be somewhere towards the end of the log. Go to that URL to create the first account.

Setup is now complete and your instance should be working.
To add another user, sign in then go to `/api/invite` and copy the URL it gives you. This will be improved in the future.

### configuration

micro uses [venera](https://github.com/sylv/venera) to load configuration files. Configuration files are validated on startup, and may log errors if invalid setups are detected. The venera page has more information, but tl;dr:

- `.microrc.yaml` is the main configuration file.
- You can override any config value with an environment variable. The key `hosts.0.url` would be set as `MICRO_HOSTS__0__URL`
- You can use other file formats, like JSON or TOML.

### updating

You should take a full database backup before updating, but you won't, will you?
The database will be automatically migrated on startup.

1. `docker compose pull micro`
2. `docker compose up -d micro`
