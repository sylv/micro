## installation

> If you need help, join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/VDMX6VQRZm). This guide assumes you are on linux with a basic understanding of linux and docker.

> To migrate from micro 0.0.x to 1.0.0, see [MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md).

1. Install `git`, `docker` and `docker-compose`
2. Download the files in this repository, `git clone https://github.com/sylv/micro.git`
3. Copy the example configs to the current directory, `cp ./micro/example/* ./`
4. Fill out `.microrc.yaml`, `Caddyfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. **It is extremely important you read through each of the 3 files and make sure you understand what they do.** Specifically, `.microrc.yaml` contains a secret that handles authentication, if it is not a secure random string everyone can sign in as anyone they want without a password.
5. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the database and micro.
6. Get the startup invite by doing `docker-compose logs micro` and copying the invite URL that should be somewhere towards the end of the log. Go to that URL to create the first account.

Setup is now complete and your instance should be working.

### updating

You should take a full database backup before updating. Pending database migrations will be applied automatically on startup.

1. `docker-compose pull micro`
2. `docker-compose up -d micro`
